## Relocation of machines in the food production division

We had the task of relocating three electrical machines in the peanut production
inorder to give space for newly bought machines. In addition we had also to
relocate there isolation switches, industrial plugs and DOLs for those that had one.

For each of the machines that we relocated we followed the following stated procedure.
We first opened the isolation switches and identified what terminals were connected
to the incoming three phase supply. We then noted the colors of the three phases,
neutral and earth wires. We proceeded to the distribution box with the aim of
disconnecting the power to the given switch by removing the respective three phase,
neutral and earth wires from the circuit breaker where they were connected.

In order to identify the circuit breaker that was connected to a given switch
we first visual identified where three phase wires with the same colour as 
those terminating at the switch were connected. Moreover, since there were more
than one circuit breaker with the same combination of colours of three phase wires
we performed the following inorder to pinpoint the exact circuit breaker that we
had to disconnect the terminals.

We first turned off one of the given circuit breakers , then proceeded to check
with a tester whether there was any voltage present in the incoming side of the
given isolation switch. If the tester bulb did not turn on , this assured us that
the turned off circuit breaker was in series with the given switch. We thus 
disconnected the three phase wires from the given circuit breaker, as the circuit
breaker remained turned off, insulated the terminals of the wires with electrical
insulation tape to prevent any short circuits.


Finally we disconnected the three phase wires, neutral and earth wires from
the switch . We also disconnected the three phase wires to the industrial socket
and DOL where it was present. In addition we disconnected the machines from the 
DOL. In conclusion we unmounted the isolation switch, industrial socket and DOL
from the wall and stored them in a secure area.
