Did some troubleshooting of a tripped circuit breaker in building c (food processing workshop)

The machines in the food processing workshop include a plum pasteurizer, 
juice pasteurizer and plumper

We found the problem to be a short circuit in the juice pasteurizer due to
the melting of a plastic connector which was decided that it would be replaced 
by a ceramic one so as to withstand the heat dissipated.

In addition the temperature controller of the plum pasteurizer was found to be
defective and thus could not be used to turn off the heater circuit through a
contacter when the desired set temperature was reached. Clients were informed 
if this and adviced to purchase a new temperature control unit.

Moreover, we headed to the honey processing facility whereby we found that the
temperature control unit of the honey warming machine to be defective hence
leading to uncontrolled heating of honey. We replaced the defective temperature
control unit , connected the live wire through it , set the preferred predetermined
temperature on the it and enclosed the electrical circuit appropriately.

## TODO
How does the BT-7 (20A 250V) temperature control unit work
