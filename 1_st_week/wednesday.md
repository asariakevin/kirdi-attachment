I revisited the basics of autocad. This included the user interface of the software,
whereby I became aware that autocad has the following sections: the drawing area,
application menu, ribbon made up of panels which is a group of buttons for similar
commands, command window, status bar and viewport.

I also engaged in basic moving techniques in the drawing area of autocad such
as zooming , panning and selecting different objects.

We were engaged in the repair  of  a juice pastuerizer control panel in building C. We found that
the plastic connector used to interface between the three phase mains and the 
control panel had suffered thermal damage due to a short circuit that had occurred
between two lines. This was concluded to have resulted due to the heavy current
drawn which dissipated a lot of heat that caused the plastic connector to melt
leading to the short circuit.

We first disconnected the pastuerizer from the mains by pulling out the industrial plug.
We then proceeded to disconnect the three phase mains supply and wires to contactors
from the thermally damaged plastic connector. Finally we connected the three phase mains
wires and contactor wires through the ceramic connectors as specified.
