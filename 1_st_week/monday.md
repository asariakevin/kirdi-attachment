I was given a tour of the facility by fellow attachees

I first was guided to the mechanical department where I met up with fellow
attaches from Moi university who all were undertaking a branch of mechanical
engineering.

We toured the mechanical workshop and was guided through various milling machines
such as the horizontal, universal milling machine.

My tour then proceeded to the leather workshop whereby I was guided through the
leather tanning process. We then proceeded to the ceramic workshop, chemical
workshop then to the food processing workshop.
